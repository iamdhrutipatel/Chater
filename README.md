# Chater üí¨
A ChatBot ü§ñ application using Natural Language Processing.

## Explanation of the Project
- First, I've trained my model with artifical neural network to predict, if it is a benign diagnosis or malignant diagnosis. In that learned so many things like how to deal with missing values or categorical values, etc.

- Second, I've trained the model with logstic regression and random forest algorithms. Also, have done randomized search to find the best parameters to train the model.

- The Dataset I've used to train my models is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data).

- To find artifical neural network trained model follow this [link](https://github.com/iamdhrutipatel/Breasttest/blob/main/Breast_Cancer_Prediction_ANN.ipynb).

- To find logistic regression and random forest trained model follow this [link](https://github.com/iamdhrutipatel/Breasttest/blob/main/Breast_Cancer_Prediction_LR_RF.ipynb).
  
## Libraries Used

## Installation Setup
#### 1. Clone the repository
You can clone this repository using command: ``https://github.com/iamdhrutipatel/Chater.git``

#### 2. Open ``ChatBot_NLP.ipynb``
You can open the ``.ipynb`` file using [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or Jupyter Notebook.<br>
Don't have **Jupyter Notebook**? Don't worry, run the following commands and you're good to go üöÄ 
> **$ pip install notebook** <br>
> **$ jupyter notebook**<br>

#### 3. Execute all the cells consecutively to run the chatbot application.

#### 4. After fireing the queries, at the end a bot will provide response according to user's query.
